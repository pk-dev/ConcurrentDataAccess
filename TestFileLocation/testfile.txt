Wikipedia is a treasure trove of the information age, albeit one with a generous sprinkling of counterfeit loot. With more than 15 billion monthly pageviews from August 2015 to August 2016, Wikipedia is a titan of online information. Fact-checkers are starting to interact with the Wikimedia Foundation to address the accuracy of its entries â€” and have found a receptive audience. The latest example is a Wikipedia "edit-a-thon" organized by Brazilian fact-checking site Lupa in partnership with investigative journalist outfit Abraji. Inspired by a prior exercise by Full Fact in the United Kingdom, the edit-a-thon dedicated a group of people to improving the accuracy of selected entries.
